"Transducers are composable algorithmic transformations. They are independent from the
context of their input and output sources and specify only the essence of the transformation
in terms of an individual element. Because transducers are decoupled from input or output
sources, they can be used in many different processes - collections, streams, channels,
observables, etc. Transducers compose directly, without awareness of input or creation
of intermediate aggregates."
